        "Theoretical Questions\n",
        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "\n",
        " ANS. Compiled languages (e.g., C, C++) are converted directly into machine code that the processor executes. They generally run faster but need to be recompiled for different platforms.\n",
        " Interpreted languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript) are executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime. They are more flexible but typically slower than compiled languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS. Exception handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors gracefully using try, except, else, and finally blocks, preventing program crashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "ANS. The finally block executes code regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, typically used for cleanup operations like closing files.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "ANS Logging is a way to track events that happen when software runs, providing a more flexible and configurable alternative to print statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "ANS __del__ is a destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed, used for cleanup activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "ANS import module imports the entire module, requiring module.function() syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "from module import function imports specific functions, allowing direct function() calls.\n",

        "ANS Multithreading: Multiple threads within a single process (shared memory, good for I/O-bound tasks)\n",

        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "Python uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to automatically reclaim memory from unused objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "The else block executes only if no exceptions were raised in the try block.\n",
